Weather forecasting has undergone significant evolution with the integration of advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, accurate predictions can be made. SARIMA captures seasonal patterns while LSTM learns long-term dependencies, enabling precise short to medium-term forecasts.
